                My family and I travelled to Spain numerous times since I was born. We usually fly into Barcelona and hire a car and go from there.	

                It has an amazing culture. Amazing food. Amazing people. I have visited the Barcelona and Real Madrid stadiums. They are both fantastic. When I was 12, I met Lionel Messi and i was extremely happy. That is one of the reasons why i love Spain so much!!

        	    America has the balance of Famous cities and historicial sights spread across the massive country. I would love to live there when I

        	    am older. America is an idealistic place to live and one day I hope to live there. The weather is a huge factor becuase i really do love the sun.
